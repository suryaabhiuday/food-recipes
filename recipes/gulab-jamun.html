    <br>
    <li>Prep time: 5 minutes</li>
    <li>Cooking time: 15-20 minutes</li>
    <li>Serves: 24 gulab jamuns (depending on the size)</li>
    <p>

        Pro tips:

        <li>Makes sure to cream the mawa & paneer well for softer gulab jamuns.</li>
        <li>The oil should not be too hot while frying.</li>
        <li>The syrup should be warm and not hot while adding the gulab jamuns after frying.</li>
    </p>


    Sugar syrup (chaashni)
    <ul>
        Ingredients:
        <li>Cheeni (sugar) 4 cups</li>
        <li>Paani (water) 3 cups</li>
        <li>Gulab Jal (rose water) 1 tbsp</li>
        <li>Choti elaichi (green cardamom) 3-4 pods</li>
    </ul>

    Method:

    Take a stock pot or wok, add sugar and water, keep stirring until it dissolves completely, bring to a boil & further
    add rose water & green cardamom, open the shell of the green cardamom to infuse its flavour, mix well & later switch
    off the flame. We do not require any sort of one string or two string consistency, it should just be a simple sugar
    syrup.
    Keep the sugar syrup aside, no need to cool down, let the temperature drop on its own. Make sure to keep them warm.


    Gulab jamun
    <ul>
        Ingredients:
        <li>Hariyali mawa 250 gm / 1 cup</li>
        <li>Malai paneer 1/4th cup / 65 gm</li>
        <li>Maida (refined flour) 4 tbsp</li>
        <li>Baking powder 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    Method:

    For making perfect soft gulab jamun we require specifically “hariyali mawa” if it’s not available you can also use
    fresh soft mawa, but try to use hariyali mawa for better results.
    <p>

        Use a big size thal and add the mawa, if the mawa is little tough, use a grater and great to break down or else
        you
        could directly start to cream (mathna) the mawa, using the base of your palm. Cream the mawa until its smooth
        and
        creamy in texture, there should be no grains in the mawa, you need to do this process for at least 15 minutes or
        until the entire batch of the mawa is smooth. This process surely may be time consuming but its very important
        as
        doing this step will make you a perfect gulab jamun.
    </p>

    Pro tip: cream in small batches for efficient and better results.

    <p>
        After creaming the mawa, take the malai paneer and grate using a small size hole, you have to cream the paneer
        as
        well in the same way as done for mawa, cream it well until its smooth in texture. You can also use chenna if not
        paneer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once they both are smooth in texture, mix well and add maida in batches, make sure not to add them all at once,
        the
        quantity of maida will differ depending on the moisture level in the paneer and mawa, so just add in batches,
        you
        need to add & mix well until it forms like a dough and it starts to leave the parath or thal. This recipe, with
        this
        quantity won’t require more than 4 or 5 or 6 tbsp of flour.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once it has mixed nicely and formed a dough like texture, add baking powder and incorporate well in the dough.
        Rest the dough for 10-15 minutes & cover with a cloth, by the time you can make the chaashni.
        After making the chaashni, divide the dough in small and equal size balls, make sure to shape them in small
        shape as
        they will get bigger in size when they will soak up the chaashni.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a weighing machine so it makes the process easy to keep every ball equal in size, if you have it then
        please
        use it or else you can also divide in equal portion roughly, dividing in equal size is necessary because when
        you’ll
        fry them, the bigger ones may be little uncooked whereas the smaller ones may burn quickly.
        Shape them in perfect roundels one by one and make sure there should not be any cracks on the gulab jamun, also
        cover the shaped balls with moist cloth to avoid them from drying, while you’re shaping few more. By the time
        your
        shaping set oil for frying.
    </p>
    <p>
        Set a wok filled with oil for frying the gulab jamuns, make sure the oil is not very hot, if you are having a
        thermometer please use it, the ideal temperature for frying the gulab jamuns should be somewhere 145- 155, if
        you're
        not having the thermometer, then drop in one gulab jamun ball to check, if it gets darken too quickly, then cool
        down the oil little bit. If the ball starts to float in few seconds and the bubbles start to appear then you're
        good
        to go.
    </p>
    <p>
        Swirl the hot oil with the spatula to make like a whirlpool, make sure to do it carefully and not spilling the
        hot
        oil over your hands, stir and add the gulab jamun balls but the spoon not touching them or else they may break,
        take
        help if required, fry in batches and do not overcrowd the kadhai.
        Fry them on low flame maintaining the temperature and keep stirring so that they get even colour and cook evenly
        from the inside as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once they are nice golden brown, immediately drop them in warm sugar, the temperature of the sugar should not
        exceed
        above 50 or the gulab jamun will become too soft and may lose its shape.
        Now, let the gulab jamun rest in the sugar syrup for minimum 4 hours so that they can absorb the syrup nicely.
        Your
        perfect gulab jamun is ready to be served, just warm them a little bit before serving to get that perfect soft
        texture.
    </p>
